This dialog is created by dialog::StandardWindow.

If you explore this library you will find all the 
old libsyllable dialogs are a part of this 
library (updated of course).

You will also notice on the right hand side is
another view.  In this view, you will be able
to play around with the new Action/ActionList
functionality.  Feel free to either click from
the dropdown or in the menu system to explore
all of the wonderful features of
dialog::Action/dialog::ActionList.
